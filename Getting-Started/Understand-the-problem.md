# UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM
Why should we go about understanding a Problem? It Might be weird to point it out, but the first step towards solving a problem is understanding the problem, we need to first understand if it's ill defined or well defined.

  
  #### An ill defined problem 
   - No proper Outline of the problems.
   - Has no Proper Outline on how to get to the solution.
   - No clear goal.


  #### A well defined problem 
   - Has Proper Outline of the problem.
   - Has clear description on how to get to the solution.
   - Proper Milestones That can indicate when certain Goals are met.



Understanding the problem also involves breaking down the problem into smaller parts. We need to find out what is the input available and what is the desired output.

Example
Consider a scenario where we have a total of 22 football players and we need to get the highest performers in other to separate them into starting eleven and second eleven.

First of it will differ by position required stats each position will be: 

 1. Goal keeper 
  - Agility: 80
  - Speed: 60
  - passing: 75
  - defence: 50
  - physical: 80


 2. Defender
  - Agility: 80
  - Speed: 70
  - passing: 75
  - defence: 85
  - physical: 90


 3. Midfielder
  - Agility: 85
  - Speed: 80
  - passing: 90
  - defence: 80
  - physical: 90

  4. Attacker
  - Agility: 93
  - Speed: 90
  - passing: 60
  - defence: 40
  - physical: 80

 ### From Problem to Solution
 Our goal is to evaluate each player in the pool to determine if they meet the required standards for their position. This structured approach helps us select the best team members effectively.

 This leads us to the next step: Pseudocode & Flowcharts, where we translate our understanding into a structured plan for implementation.

  That brings us to the next lesson [Pseudo code & Flowcharts](../Algorithms/Pseudocode and Flowchart/pseudocode.md)
