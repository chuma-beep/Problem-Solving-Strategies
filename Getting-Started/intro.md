# Problem solving strategies

## Objective
The Objective of this repo is not just to bring to light but also to enhance our understanding of problem solving strategies. I believe that the more we simplify tough topics then the more our understanding grows.


# What are problem solving Strategies?

These are methods in which a problem should be approached in other to achieve a desired outcome.


## Topics
1. Understanding the Problem
2. Trail and Error
3. Means End Analysis
4. Heuristic 
5. Abstraction
6. Flow Chart and Pseudo Code
7. Algorithms
8. Decomposition and Modularisation
9. Testing and Debugging



### Note these are also very important steps but these require more application than theory so i won't be verbose on them.
 1. Past Experience
 2. Bring in a facilitator
 3. Develop a decision matrix for evaluation
 4. Ask your Peers for help
 5. Step away from problem
