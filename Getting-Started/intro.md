# Problem solving strategies

## Objective
The Objective of this repo is not just to bring to light but also to enchance our understanding of problem solving startegies. I belive that the more we simplify tough topic then the more our understanding grows.


# What problem solving Strategies?

These are methods in which a problem should be approached in other to achieve a desired outcome.


## Topics
1. Understanding the Problem
2. Trail an Error
3. MeansEnd Analysis
4. Heuristic 
5. FlowChart and PsuedoCode
6. Algorithms


### Note these are also very important steps but these require more application than theory so i won't be verbose on them
 -Past Experience
 -Bring in a facilitator
 -Develop a decision matrix for evaluation
 -Ask your Peers for help
 -Step away from problem
