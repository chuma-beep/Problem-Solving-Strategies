#Big O 

 Big O other wise known as big O notation deals with the worst case scenario of an algorithm. This is used to measure the running time  ( the amount of time it takes for an algorithm to carry out a task.)

We have several sun times that depicts this:

- O(log n) this know as log time. The example algorithm is Binary Search
- O(n) known as linear time. An example algorithm is linear Search
- O(n * log n) known as line arithmetic time or logarithmic time. An example algorithm is Quick Sort 
- O(n2) known as quadratic time. An example algorithm is selection sort
- O(n!) known as factorial time complexity, an example is the travelling salesperson.
