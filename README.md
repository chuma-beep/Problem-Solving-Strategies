# Problem-Solving-Strategies


   I am starting this repo because I got inspired by a course in NOUN, it introduced me to computational approach to problem solving. I am intrigued with this new way of thinking and how it can enhance ones reasoning.
   I hope it helps not just me but others also interested in computational thinking and those who want to able to slove 
   interesting problems
 

## Prerequistes
I'll advice you to first learn a programming langauge if you wish to get the most of this repo. Most of the Code will be written in JavaScript and Python. I chose these languages beacause they are easier for beginners to learn. there are also some free resources where you can pick up any of these programming langauges if you choose to do so. 

*Please note you are to foucs on core concepts that can be applied across sevelral other languages, like variables, data types, loops, conditionals, and functions.*
