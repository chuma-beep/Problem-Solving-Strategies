   I am starting this repo because I got inspired by a course in NOUN, it introduced me to computational approach to problem solving. I am intrigued with this new way of thinking and how it can enhance ones reasoning.
   I hope it helps not just me but others also interested in computaional thinking and those who want to able to slove 
   interesting problems
